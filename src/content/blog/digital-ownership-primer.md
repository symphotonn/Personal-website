When you "buy" a movie on Amazon, you don't own it. You're licensing it. Amazon can revoke access at any time. They've done it before.

When you "own" your social media profile, you don't own it. The platform does. They can suspend you, delete your history, or change the rules whenever they want.

This isn't ownership. It's tenancy at the landlord's pleasure.

## What Real Ownership Means

True ownership has specific properties:

1. **Exclusive control** — Only you can use, transfer, or destroy the asset
2. **Permissionless** — No third party can block your access
3. **Censorship-resistant** — No one can take it from you without your consent
4. **Portable** — You can move it between contexts

Traditional property law enforces these through legal systems. In digital realms, we need cryptography.

## The Technical Foundation

Public-key cryptography enables digital ownership. When you control a private key, you — and only you — can sign transactions. No one can forge your signature. No one can spend your assets without your key.

This is the foundation of cryptocurrency, but the implications go far beyond money:

- **Digital identity** that no platform can revoke
- **Data** that only you can decrypt
- **Credentials** that are portable between services
- **Creative works** with provable provenance

## The Tradeoffs

Self-custody comes with responsibility. Lose your keys, lose your assets. There's no "forgot password" link. No customer support to call.

This scares people. And reasonably so. We've been trained to rely on institutions to safeguard our digital lives.

But consider the alternative: trusting those same institutions to act in your interest, forever, without fail. History suggests skepticism is warranted.

## Finding Balance

Full self-sovereignty isn't for everyone — at least not yet. The tooling is improving, but it's still early.

What matters is understanding the spectrum:

- **Full custody**: You hold the keys, you bear the responsibility
- **Partial custody**: Multi-sig, social recovery, smart contract wallets
- **Custodial**: Someone else holds keys on your behalf

Each point on this spectrum trades convenience for sovereignty. Know where you stand. Make conscious choices.

## Building Toward Ownership

The future I'm building toward is one where digital ownership is the default — where you don't need to be a cryptography expert to control your own digital life.

It's achievable. The primitives exist. What's needed is better interfaces, better education, and more people who care.

Do you?
