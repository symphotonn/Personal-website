The internet was supposed to be the great equalizer. A decentralized network where anyone could publish, connect, and transact without permission from gatekeepers. For a moment, it seemed like that promise might be realized.

Instead, we've witnessed an unprecedented concentration of power. Today, a handful of companies mediate most human connection, information flow, and digital commerce. They know where we go, what we buy, who we talk to, and increasingly, what we think.

## The Four Pillars

Freedom technology rests on four interconnected pillars:

### Privacy

Your data is yours. Not your ISP's, not your government's, not an advertising conglomerate's. Privacy isn't about having something to hide—it's about having the autonomy to choose what you reveal, to whom, and when.

Without privacy, there is no freedom of thought. When you know you're being watched, you censor yourself. You conform. You become predictable.

### Attention

The attention economy treats your focus as a resource to be harvested. Every notification, every infinite scroll, every "one more episode" is an extraction. Your attention is your most precious resource—it's quite literally what you spend your life on.

Freedom technology helps you reclaim it.

### Ownership

True digital ownership means holding assets without an intermediary who can freeze, censor, or confiscate them. It means your digital identity isn't subject to platform whims. It means the fruits of your digital labor actually belong to you.

### Truth

In an age of deepfakes and synthetic media, verification becomes essential. Freedom technology provides tools for establishing provenance, authenticity, and reputation in trustless environments.

## Building the Future

This isn't about rejecting technology or retreating to some pre-digital existence. Technology is power, and power will be built with or without us.

The question is: who will that power serve?

I believe in building tools that serve individuals rather than extract from them. Tools that enhance human agency rather than diminish it. Tools that default to privacy, respect attention, enable ownership, and facilitate truth.

This is what I mean by freedom technology. And it matters more than ever.
